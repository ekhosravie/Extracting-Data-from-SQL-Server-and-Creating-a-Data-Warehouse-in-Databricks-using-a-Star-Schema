Extracting Data from SQL Server and Creating a Data Warehouse in Databricks using a Star Schema
This code defines the SQL queries, JDBC URL, and SQL driver path at the beginning of the script. It also defines the table names and functions for data transformation. The extract_data() function is not defined in this code, but it can be implemented as shown in the previous example.
The load_data() function is defined to load data from a DataFrame into a Delta table. The extract_data() function is called to extract data from SQL Server tables, and the transform_<table>_dim() and transform_fact_sales() functions are called to transform the data for each table. Finally, the load_data() function is called to load the transformed data into Delta tables.

Note that the example transformation functions transform_product_dim(), transform_customer_dim(), transform_time_dim(), transform_promotion_dim(), and transform_fact_sales() are left empty, and you should modify them according to your specific data transformation requirements. 

This function uses the pandas library to read data from a SQL Server table using the provided SQL query, JDBC URL, and SQL driver path. It then converts the pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame using the createDataFrame() method of the Spark session.

You can use this function in the code provided in the previous example to extract data from SQL Server tables.

Note that you need to install the pandas library and the pyodbc library (or any other library that provides SQL Server support) before running this code.
